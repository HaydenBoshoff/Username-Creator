Project: Username Creator
Created By: Hayden Boshoff (github.com/haydenboshoff)


===========================
=== Project Description ===
===========================

The project is a simple GUI that allows you to store a username (If it is available, else you will get a message telling you that the username is taken).

This project was created to allow me to mess around with the concepts and put my knowledge into practice. It does store the usernames in a txt file which isn't the safest, but again this project was intended for practice.


==================
=== How to use ===
==================

Just simply run the main.py file, if you do not have the text file it works with (username.txt), then it will automatically create it for you (please note that if you want to change the name of the txt file you will need to manually change the file the code points to). Once the program is running just simply click into the entry box and type your username.

You can click the "Create" button or you can press enter.

Note:
- The program does not accept symbols and special characters. (including spaces)
- The program does not accept Python code. (You are welcome to try break it)
- The program only accepts ASCII letters and digits.
